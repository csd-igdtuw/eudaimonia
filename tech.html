        The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more 
        sustainable future for all".

Centre of Sustainable Development of IGDTUW believes in the way of thinking and making change happen by contributing towards 13 (out of 17 SDGs). 
 IGDTUW students banded together to create a space where they could 
 contribute to society and the environment.

<h3>COLLABORATION WITH INNERVE</h3>

CSD IGDTUW collaborated with Innerve 2022 in order to seek sustainability
 with the help of the technical youth of the country to host an Ideathon 
 and a hackathon on topics related to healthcare, energy, and education. 
 These subjects included time poverty, work-life balance, and an automatic
  spam mail elimination bot wherein participants could unleash their 
  creativity and can make a chrome extension, app or website for the same.

<h3>TECH EVENTS BY CSD TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY</h3>

We believe in Fostering innovation, promoting inclusive economic growth, 
and developing a versatile infrastructure for the generations, 
without compromising on the ability of future generations to meet 
their own needs.
Ideate2Sustain was a tech event organized by Cognito in collaboration 
with GeeksforGeeks Student Chapter IGDTUW that took place on April 17, 2022. 
The Ideathon was a team-based competition on the 17 Sustainable Development
 Goals as stated by the UN where participants were required to ideate and 
 come up with a solution toward realizing these goals. We received over 
 800 registrations, out of which 150 teams were shortlisted on the basis
  of the MCQ round followed by presentation ideas by shortlisted teams.
   We got excellent sustainability solutions.

The Centre for Sustainable Development has made an effort to 
use technology to attain its sustainable development goals. 
All of this was made possible solely by the use of modern 
technology which included a virtual debate competition that prompted 
participants to learn about and discuss ways to make various regions 
of our nation more sustainable, a virtual round-table discussion that 
raised participants' awareness of various aspects of sustainable development, 
and a social media campaign to dispel myths about the LGBTQ+ community.

<h3>USING TECH RESOURCES TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY 
</h3>
<h4>TWITTER CAMPAIGNS</h4>

<h5>KHANA BHI PEETA HAI (Team Eudaimonia)-</h5>

Team Eudaimonia conducted this campaign over a span of two days, from 1st June'22 
to 2nd June'22 on Twitter, where awareness was raised on the water footprint of 
various food items. 
Students were asked to create posters for this campaign that compared a product's
 water footprint to a less water-intensive alternative. They were required to 
 tweet on their handles and reply to Our tweets using some catchy hashtags. 
 This campaign aimed to educate everyone about how the everyday food items that 
 we consume require gallons of water to get produced. Because the water footprint 
 of each food item varies, we urged students to study and make wise purchasing 
 decisions when buying food.



<h4>SOCIAL MEDIA </h4>

Social Media is a powerful tool for reaching out to a large audience. 
We took up small initiatives through social media campaigning to educate
 the community about crucial issues and build momentum to bring change and 
 achieve goals set by the UN. We surveyed 600+ people on their knowledge about 
 Water Footprint, peace, carbon footprint, Sustainable fashion, STEM, and 
 Digiteracy through social media, and planned our sessions according to
  the received responses. We spread our word through posters on Instagram, 
  LinkedIn, and Twitter and received a lot of appreciation, and positive 
  reactions for the initiative from social media platforms. We created 
  attractive posters, reels, and presentations and received active 
  participation at all the events from our followers.
